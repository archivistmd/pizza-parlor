# Pizza Menu

#### By **Mesha Devan**

#### An independent project done for Epicodus. The user can access the website for the pizza company "Toppings-R-Us" where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc.), a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost.

#### The objective was to:
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
